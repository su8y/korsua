### Introduction
I am a developer dedicated to adhering to the principles of Clean Code and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). My approach emphasizes a clear understanding of the project’s purpose and business objectives before engaging with technical solutions. I consistently focus on addressing sustainable challenges that drive long-term impact, rather than prioritizing specific technologies for their own sake.

Additionally, I believe that test-driven development fosters trust and reliability in the codebase, supporting high-quality deliverables through verification rather than assumption.

### Key Skills
* Clean Code methodologies
* Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
* Architecture Design
* technical Documentation
  
### Experience
* 2019 - 2023-06: 3-year associate degree in Computer Software, Kyungmin University
* 2023-07 - 2023-12: Internship at JBT, Development Headquarters Team
* 2024-01 - Present: Core Development Team, JBT

I am committed to delivering thoughtful, well-architected solutions that balance technical excellence with a deep understanding of business needs, ensuring lasting value to any team or project.
